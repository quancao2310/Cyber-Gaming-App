# Cyber Gaming App
This is the repository of Cyber Gaming App - the project used for Database System Assignment semester 231

# Some steps to starting the develoment
* Clone the project
* Download Node.js
* Install all dependencies for the project
* Set up a database server at port 3306
```
  cd server
  npm i
```
```
  cd client
  npm i
```
* Start development environment:
```
  npm run dev
```

# Some notes:
* If you get errors when using "npm i" to install the dependencies, try another options like "npm install --force" or "npm install --legacy-peer-deps"
* In the server-side, I use ESModule syntax, so make sure when import a module from a .js file, don't forget the extension .js
* (Update in the future...)
